											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I've always been interested in video games, which has led to an interest in game balance and level design. As a Game Design & Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, I have been slowly building experience in programming languages and game engines so I can better understand the kind of work that goes into making video games. I have knowledge in C#, C++, and Java, minimal knowledge of Python, and I have experience in Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Additionally, I have experience in web design with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and I am currently learning Node.js.</p>

										<h3>Robo Runner</h3>
										<p>Robo Runner is a Web game that uses PixiJS, a WebGL renderer. The object of the game is to get the highest score you can by avoiding the obstacles that come your way. In between attempts, you can upgrade various stats that will give you more flexibility in achieving a greater score. The project uses PixiJS to render text and sprites, and uses howler.js for in-game sounds. I was responsible for both game logic as well as the sprites as part of a class project. I was able to utilize the various skills from programming in other languages to make the game function on the Web.</p>

										<h3>EDH Commander Finder</h3>
										<p>The EDH Commander Finder is a Web application that uses the Scryfall API, an API for Magic: The Gathering. The application allows you to set parameters such as name, colors, and mana cost, and returns the possible commanders that fulfill those requirements. Each image is a clickable link that leads to that card's Scryfall entry. The program uses Web storage to remember the last name you inputted. I designed the entire page and wrote the JavaScript for a class assignment, but it was also something that I wanted to be able to use myself, since I play the game. This was the first time I had done something with an API, so figuring out what search terms I wanted was one of the biggest challenges for this project.</p>

										<h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Builder</h3>
										<p>The Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Builder is an application utilizing the YGOPRODeck API to search for cards, as well as an internal API to create and store Yu-Gi-Oh! Decks. Yu-Gi-Oh! is one of my favorite card games, and I really wanted to create something that could be useful for people who want to play and keep track of their decks. The project is hosted on the Heroku cloud platform using Node.js. You can search for cards and add them into your deck, then save your deck and come back to it at any time. After the experience I got from using the Scryfall API from the previous project, I felt a lot more comfortable with many aspects of this project.</p>
