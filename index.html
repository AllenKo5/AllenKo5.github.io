											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I've always been interested in video games, which has led to an interest in game balance and level design. As a Game Design & Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, I have been building experience in programming languages and game engines so I can better understand the kind of work that goes into making video games. I have knowledge in C#, C++, and Java, minimal knowledge of Python, and I have experience in Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Additionally, I have experience in web development, with experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, rendering applications with React, and have worked in both front-end and back-end development with Node.js.</p>

										<h3>Robo Runner</h3>
										<p>Robo Runner is a Web game that uses PixiJS, a WebGL renderer. The object of the game is to get the highest score you can by avoiding the obstacles that come your way. In between attempts, you can upgrade various stats that will give you more flexibility in achieving a greater score. The project uses PixiJS to render text and sprites, and uses howler.js for in-game sounds. I was responsible for both game logic as well as the sprites as part of a class project. I was able to utilize the various skills from programming in other languages to make the game function on the Web.</p>

										<h3>EDH Commander Finder</h3>
										<p>The EDH Commander Finder is a Web application that uses the Scryfall API, an API for Magic: The Gathering. The application allows you to set parameters such as name, colors, and mana cost, and returns the possible commanders that fulfill those requirements. Each image is a clickable link that leads to that card's Scryfall entry. The program uses Web storage to remember the last name you inputted. I designed the entire page and wrote the JavaScript for a class assignment, but it was also something that I wanted to be able to use myself, since I play the game. This was the first time I had done something with an API, so figuring out what search terms I wanted was one of the biggest challenges for this project.</p>

										<h3>DragonFable Damage Estimator</h3>
										<p>A personal project of mine, the DragonFable Damage Estimator is a web tool I created for my own personal use. I primarily use it to help calculate and document the skills of bosses in DragonFable, an online role-playing game. I collaborate with others in creating a player-maintained community resource, a wiki that aims to create in-depth synopses of all of the bosses in the game's endgame area, constantly updating mechanics and keeping track of damage numbers. The goal of this project was not just to brush up on my web design skills, but also to make it responsive and intuitive.</p>
