											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I've always been interested in video games, which has led to an interest in game balance and level design. As a Game Design & Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, I have been building experience in programming languages and game engines so I can better understand the kind of work that goes into making video games. I have knowledge in C#, C++, Java, and Python, and I have experience developing games in Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Additionally, I have experience in web development, with experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, rendering applications with React, and have worked in both front-end and back-end development with Node.js. I'm currently learning how to use TypeScript and Angular, to further increase my relevan skillset. In the future, I'm looking to learn PHP and SQL.</p>

										<h3>DragonFable Endgame Wiki</h3>
										<p>I'm one of the primary editors for the DragonFable Endgame Wiki. This wiki is for the Inn at the Edge of Time, a challenge area in the online role-playing game <a href="https://www.dragonfable.com/">DragonFable</a>. This challenge area is full of various bosses with unique mechanics and rotations, and I am one of the community members that helps document this data after its release. I have also created <a href="https://darkflarezero.github.io/projects/dfCalc/index.html">tools</a> to help streamline the discovery process.</p>

										<h3>ChangelingVR</h3>
										<p>I am a member of the development team for ChangelingVR, a first person virtual reality game in development at the RIT School of Interactive Games and Media and College of Art and Design. I primarily worked with the team as a web developer, creating parts of the website and programming some of the web experiences.</p>

										<h3>The Library (WIP)</h3>
										<p> A personal project of mine to help document the various decklists and strategies of past formats in Magic the Gathering. I've played a lot with these decks to learn their play patterns and discover their various niches, and I plan to document my findings here. This app was primarily created as a way for me to learn TypeScript/Angular, so it remains a work in progress for now, as I continue to learn more about Angular development.</p>
